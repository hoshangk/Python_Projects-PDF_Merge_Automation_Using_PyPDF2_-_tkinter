You are expected to code a Python program to customize which pages you want in the combined PDF.
#-----------------------------------
High level Steps : 
At a high level, here’s what the program will do:
1> Find all PDF files in the current working directory.
2> Sort the filenames so the PDFs are added in order.
3> Write each page, excluding the first page, of each PDF to the output file.
#-----------------------------------
#--implementation Steps 
In terms of implementation, your code will need to do the following:

1> Call os.listdir() to find all the files in the working directory and remove any non-PDF files.
2> Call Python’s sort() list method to alphabetize the filenames.
3> Create a PdfFileWriter object for the output PDF.
4> Loop over each PDF file, creating a PdfFileReader object for it.
5> Loop over each page(except the first) in each PDF file.
6> Add the pages to the output PDF.
7> Write the output PDF to a file named final.pdf.
8> Code and save this project as combinePdfs.py
