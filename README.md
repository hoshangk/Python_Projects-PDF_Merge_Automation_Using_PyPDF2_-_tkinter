# Python_Projects-PDF_Merge_Automation_Using_PyPDF2_-_tkinter

This is a simple project where a daily boring job is made automated. Considering we have n number of PDFs and we want to merge them together. But a condition, we dont want to merge all pages of all the pdfs. We will select the pages runtime.

This is the best practise porject where each time, pdf will open and will ask user to choose which pages user wants to merge. 

Tkinter is the library which opens any files into GUI in python. and PyPDF2 is a library which will used to process the PDFs in python.

One supporting file gs927w32.exe will be required to view the files in tkinter and to process them.
